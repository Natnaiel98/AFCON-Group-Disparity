The second article was the transfermarkt page for the FIFA Men's Ranking. Rankings that were closest to the date of the AFCON under review were selected.

Average Ranking of the group as well as the difference betwee the third and fourth lowest ranked teams in a group. Finally, the code produces visualizations to display inequality between the groups.
